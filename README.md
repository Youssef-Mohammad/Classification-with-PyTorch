# Classification-with-PyTorch
Hello, We're building a classification model with PyTorch framework and fixing the might be faced problems
We've used the 'make_circles' function to create a cirle like data and then try to classify them.
In version V1 we've created the basic bricks for the model, but we've faced the problem of non-linearity.
We've fixed that in V2 by using a non_linear activation function, which is the rectified lineat unit (ReLu).
the model accuracy then went very well.
