# Classification-with-PyTorch
Hello, We're building a classification model with PyTorch framework and fixing the might be faced problems
We've used the 'make_circles' function to create a cirle like data and then try to classify them.
In version V1 we've created the basic bricks for the model, but we've faced the problem of non-linearity.
